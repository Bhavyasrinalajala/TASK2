TECHNOLOGY STACK :


FRONTEND :

HTML: For structuring the user interface (input, button, and result area).

CSS: For styling and making the app visually appealing.

JavaScript: For dynamic content updates and API integration.

API:

OpenWeatherMap API: Provides real-time weather data (temperature, humidity, description).
Project Structure:

HTML:

A simple layout with an input field, a button, and a results display area.

CSS:

A clean and modern design using basic CSS for centering, spacing, and responsiveness.

JAVASCRIPT:

Handles user interaction, API requests, and DOM updates.

HOW IT WORKS:

User enters a city name in the input field.
The "Get Weather" button triggers a JavaScript function.
The function fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
Weather details like temperature, description, and humidity are displayed dynamically.
If the city is invalid, an error message is shown.
Key Learning Objectives:
