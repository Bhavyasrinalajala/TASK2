OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

PROJECT NAME: WEATHER FORECAST APP

OVERVIEW

Objective:
To build a simple and responsive web application that provides real-time weather information for a given city using the OpenWeatherMap API.

Features:

Search for a City:

Users can input a city name to fetch its weather data.

Weather Information:

Displays temperature, weather description (e.g., clear sky, rain), and humidity.

Responsive Design:

Ensures the app works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices.

Error Handling:

Provides user-friendly error messages for invalid inputs or failed API requests

Technology Stack:

Frontend:

HTML: For structuring the user interface (input, button, and result area).

CSS: For styling and making the app visually appealing.

JavaScript: For dynamic content updates and API integration.

API:

OpenWeatherMap API: Provides real-time weather data (temperature, humidity, description).
Project Structure:

HTML:

A simple layout with an input field, a button, and a results display area.

CSS:

A clean and modern design using basic CSS for centering, spacing, and responsiveness.

JavaScript:

Handles user interaction, API requests, and DOM updates.

How It Works:

User enters a city name in the input field.
The "Get Weather" button triggers a JavaScript function.
The function fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
Weather details like temperature, description, and humidity are displayed dynamically.
If the city is invalid, an error message is shown.
Key Learning Objectives:

API Integration:

How to use APIs to fetch and display data.

Asynchronous JavaScript:

Handling fetch and working with promises/async-await.

Dynamic DOM Manipulation:

Updating the webpage in real-time based on user input.

Error Handling:

Building a robust app with meaningful error messages.
